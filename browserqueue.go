// browserLoadStagger is the minimum spacing browser mode puts between two page

// conversation of every issue an agent is working, and those loads used to be
// issued back to back: a run watching enough repositories, boards, and
// conversations fired the whole burst at GitHub the moment the tick began, N
// requests at once every interval (issue #450). Spacing them means a run's
// requests arrive as a steady trickle rather than a spike, so 5 watched pages
// load at +0s, +2.5s, +5s, +7.5s and +10s.

// queue's working set for after its last load. It is more than one because a
// compressed queue takes a whole interval to work through the pages it is
// pacing, and a page must not fall out of the count between two of its own
// loads or the queue would keep rediscovering the demand it is already serving.
// A page glorp has genuinely stopped watching ages out of the count instead of
// holding the spacing down for the rest of the run.

// queue for the whole run rather than one per reader, because the burst it
// exists to smooth is the sum of what all the readers do on the same tick: the
// issues page of every repository, every project board, and the conversation of
// every issue an agent is working.
//
// Loads are spaced browserLoadStagger apart by default. That spacing only holds
// while the pages due within one poll interval fit inside it; past that point a
// run that insisted on 2.5s per load would take longer than its own interval to
// get round them all and fall further behind on every tick, so the spacing
// compresses to interval/N.
//
// N is the number of distinct pages the queue has loaded recently, not the
// number of callers waiting on it: the readers mostly load their pages one
// after another (the issue list walks its targets in turn), so at any instant
// the queue has one caller and no idea that twenty more loads are behind it.
// Counting the pages themselves sees the whole demand even while the queue is
// throttling it, and settles where a full pass over them takes one interval.
