// path the kernel can act on, but an ngrok agent was still found running twelve
// days after the run that started it (issue #364): the guard belongs to the
// glorp build that started the child, so an agent left behind by an older
// build, or by a reaper that was killed along with its parent, has nobody left
// to clean it up. Such an agent is not idle waste — it owns the local ngrok API
// port and consumes one of the account's simultaneous agent sessions, and a
// couple of them make every later run fail with ERR_NGROK_108 — so glorp sweeps
