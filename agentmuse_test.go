// message twice: once token by token on run.output.delta, and once complete on
// run.terminal.completed after the run is over. Decoding the deltas is what
// makes progress visible while the agent is still working, so the terminal
// events are ignored rather than printing the message a second time, and
// tool.result is ignored too because its payload.text is the tool's entire
// output rather than a summary of the call.

// TestMuseProgressCarriesToolCalls pins the one thing Muse's stream needed the

// was called with: the name appears alone on task.lifecycle.proposed as a task
// kind shared with model turns ("tool.read_file" beside "model.meta.response"),
// and on tool.result beside payload.text, which is the tool's entire output
// rather than a summary of the call. The definition therefore reads the name
// out of task.lifecycle.proposed through a per-event-type override, and tells
// the two kinds apart by the "tool." prefix that only a call carries. The name
// renders without a detail because no event carries the call's arguments.
