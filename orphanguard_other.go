// macOS and the BSDs offer no equivalent of Linux's parent-death signal or
// Windows' job objects, so the kernel cannot take glorp's subprocesses down with
// it. A supervised reaper stands in for that (issue #266): glorp holds the write
// end of a pipe to a small shell process and reports the process group of every
// child it owns. The kernel closes that pipe when glorp's process object is
// destroyed — including on a SIGKILL that runs no userspace cleanup at all — and
// the reaper then terminates every group still recorded.
//
// Only groups glorp still owns are recorded, so a normal shutdown, which already
// reaps its own children, leaves the reaper with nothing to do and no chance of
// signalling a process group whose id has since been reused.
